## **Why does Meson choose expensive Ethereum?**

Meson supports Ethereum as the first infrastructure layer to ensure the most significant ecosystem in crypto. ERC20 is the most adopted standard, it makes sure everything works fine and has the most compatible situation. Yes, the problem exists in the gas area, so supporting more infra like Arweave-smartweave, Solana, Polygon, ZK-Rollup is onboarding.

## **Do I have to exchange my test tokens? **

NO.

A very important reason why they are currently test tokens is to make sure everything goes smoothly step by step. You don't have to exchange your test tokens and this is not even recommended if you care much about the gas fee. However, if you would like to save your test tokens on some blockchain to keep them in another way, doing the exchange to Ethereum Network would be a nice option for you.

## What could I benefit from if I stake my test tokens?

Nothing yet.

On the Dashboard of [Meson.network](https://meson.network), there are "TokenBalance" and "Stake" pages. Doing the EXCHANGE at "TokenBalance" transfers your tokens from the database of Meson to the blockchain of Ethereum. And doing the STAKE at "Stake" transfers your tokens from the blockchain of Ethereum back to the database of Meson.

As mentioned above, the default status of your test tokens is already STAKE. However, you can't get any earnings for the status of Stake yet. So please do not exchange your Meson Test Tokens if you wish to stake them, as it would just cost two times your Ethereum gas fee while back to square one.

## Can I trade(transfer) my test tokens after exchanging them to Ethereum?

Not yet.&#x20;

The functions of transfer for Meson Test Tokens on Ethereum are locked. After the double check of the contract safety, the transfer functions will open to the public.
