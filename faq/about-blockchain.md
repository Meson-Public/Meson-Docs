# About Blockchain

## Where is the blockchain needed in the project?

1. With the help of blockchain mining, everyone can join our network rather than having a meeting with the salesperson or signing any contract.
2. Token mining rules will be programmed on the chain.
3. The future plans will be voted on the chain.
4. Token will be distributed on decentralized infrastructure, so everyone can literally own it and trade it.
5. We believe blockchain is such powerful that we can have the chance to build the world's biggest marketplace. It's crazy but it is just like any other unbridled achievement ^^
