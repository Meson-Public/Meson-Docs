# Test Period

## **When will the testing period continue last?**

We wish to launch Meson on the MainNet at Q3-Q4 of 2021. If there is some big success, it can be earlier possibly.

## **What is the difference in the current testing period?**

All the Testnet Tokens will be mapped to 1% of the MainNet Tokens. According to [FAQ-Token](https://docs.meson.network/faq/token), there will be 100,000,000 initial Meson Tokens, of which there will be 1,000,000 Tokens are used as the exchange of TestNet Tokens.

**Your MainNet Tokens = \(Your TestNet Tokens / All TestNet Tokens\) \* \(1% \* All MainNet Tokens\)                           = \(Your TestNet Tokens / All TestNet Tokens\) \* 1,000,000**

> **For example, let's assume there will be total 160,000,000 TestNet Tokens at last, and you have 2,000,000 TestNet Tokens that time, then you will get \(2,000,000 / 160,000,000\) \* 1,000,000 = 125,000 MainNet Tokens.**

## **How many TestNet Tokens will be** distributed?

We don't know, and we can't make a guarantee yet. It is determined by the date when Meson will launch into MainNet.
