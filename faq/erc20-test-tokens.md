## **Why does Meson choose expensive Ethereum?**

Meson supports Ethereum as the first infrastructure layer to ensure the most significant ecosystem in crypto. ERC20 is the most adopted standard, it makes sure everything works fine and has the most compatible situation. Yes, the problem exists in the gas area, so supporting more infra like Arweave-smartweave, Solana, Polygon, ZK-Rollup is onboarding.

## **Do I have to exchange my test tokens?**

NO.

A very important reason why they are currently test tokens is to make sure everything goes smoothly step by step.&#x20;

You don't have to exchange your test tokens and this is not even recommended if you care much about the gas fee. However, if you would like to save your test tokens on some blockchain, keeping them in another way, doing the exchange to Ethereum Network would be a nice option for you.
