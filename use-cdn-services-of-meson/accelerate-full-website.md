**Step2, Type in the path of the website you want to accelerate.**

Click "Check Input Url" and "Add Record" if it is validated.

**Step3, Change the original path into the new one.**

Change the source link of the resources on your websites.&#x20;

The first-time visit will still be redirected to the source link; but after the resources are already cached, your website resources could be well distributed to worldwide visitors at high speed by the decentralized terminals of Meson Network.
