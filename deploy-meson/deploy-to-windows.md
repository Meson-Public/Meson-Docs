# Deploy to Windows

It's much recommended to use Cloud Servers\(GCP, AWS, Azure, Alibaba, etc.\) which are easier and more stable. But if you still want to try to mine on your own PC at home with the network router, you need to have a direct public IP and set up the port forwarding rules for your router. This could be complex while your income might be low because your upload bandwidth is usually not high and stable.

## Be sure to have a direct public IP

For public IP, you could check the IP address on the dashboard of your router, and compare it with the one you searched "My IP" from the website. If they are different, it means you don't own a public IP, and you have to get help from your network service provider or use Intranet penetration to deploy Meson then.

## Be sure to **Set up the Port Forwarding Rules for your router**

This step is important for your own personal computer to run Meson.

You could search ——

**"Port Forwarding" + \[Your Router Brand\]** at YouTube/Google/etc...

That is to change the configuration to tell your router this IP is connected with your PC so that Meson could find your device\(server\) through your router.
